/*
   why we don't use var in the javascript :
       in the intial days, javascript does not work under the concept of scope 
       so using the var (it only has the global scope) the programmers has to declare variables with different names through out the code 
       because it has the global scope once the variable is declared ; the programmer can't manuplate the variable with same name 
       it would change the whole program code whre the same named variables are declared;
       To overcome this they introduced let and const where it contains block scope and function scope
